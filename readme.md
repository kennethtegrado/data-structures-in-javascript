# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counter

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values

This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings

### Anagram Problem

```javascript
function validAnagram(string1, string2) {
    const lookup = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < string1.length; i++) {
        lookup[string1[i]] = ++lookup[string1[i]] || 1;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < string1.length; i++) {
        const letter = string2[i];
        if (!lookup[letter]) return false;
        else lookup[letter] -= 1;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Multiple Pointers

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

### Counting Unique Values in an array

```javascript
function countUniqueValues(array) {
    let i = 0;
    for (let j = 1; j < array.length; j++) {
        if (array[i] !== array[j]) {
            i++;
            array[i] = array[j];
        }
    }
    return i ? ++i : 0;
}
```

### Average Pair

```javascript
function averagePair(arr, target) {
    if (!arr.length) return false;
    let start = 0;
    let end = arr.length - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
        if ((arr[start] + arr[end]) / 2 < target) start++;
        else if ((arr[start] + arr[end]) / 2 > target) end--;
        else return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Is Subsequence

```javascript
function isSubsequence(first, second) {
    let i = first.length - 1;
    for (let j = 0, pointer = 0; j < second.length; j++) {
        if (!first[pointer]) break;
        if (first[pointer] === second[j]) {
            pointer++;
            i--;
        }
    }
    return i ? true : false;
}
```

## Sliding Window Pattern

This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

### Finding the maximum sum of a subarray

```javascript
function maxSubSumArray(arr, num) {
    let maxSum = 0;
    let tempSum = 0;
    if (arr.length < num) return null;
    let max = -Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) maxSum += arr[i];
    tempSum = maxSum;

    for (let i = num; i < arr.length; i++) {
        tempSum = tempSum - arr[i - num] + arr[i];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, tempSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Divide and Conquer

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.

This pattern can tremendously `decrease time complexity`

### Binary Search

```javascript
function search(array, val) {
    let min = 0;
    let max = array.length - 1;
    while (min <= max) {
        let middle = Math.floor((min + max) / 2);
        let currentElement = array[middle];
        if (currentElement < val) min = middle + 1;
        else if (currentElement > val) max = middle - 1;
        else return middle;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

# Recursion

A process (a function) that calls itself

Follows the logic of recurrence relation

# Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search

We iterate every element on our array

**Big O**
`Best Case` is O(1) where we were able to find the element that we are looking for on the spot.

`Worst Case` is O(n) where we need to search the last element in our array

## Binary Search

A much faster form of search (Only works on sorted array)

> Rather than eliminating one element at a time, we eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time

**Big O Notation**
`Best Case` is O(1) where we were able to find the element that we are looking for on the spot;

`Worst Case` is O(logn) where we weren't able to immediately find the element we are looking for

# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection so that the are items are in some kind of order.

Examples:

-   Sorting numbers form smallest to largest
-   Sorting names alphabetically
-   Sorting movies based on release year
-   Sorting movies based on revenue

## Bubble Sort

A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top

> O(n^2)

## Selection Sort

The opposite of bubble sort, it places small values into sorted position

> O(n^2)

## Insertion Sort

Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted

## Merge Sort

## Quick Sort

## Radix Sort

# Data Structures

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

### Classes in JavaScript

-   A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods

## Linked Lists

A data structure that contains a head, tail, and length property. It consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

## Singly Linked Lists

Are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required. Arrays contain a built-in index whereas Linked Lists do not.

The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like stacks and queues.

### Methods

-   push
    -   Add a new node at the end of the list
-   pop
    -   Remove the last node and return that node
-   shift
    -   Remove the first node and return that node
-   unshift
    -   Add a new node at the start of the list
-   get
    -   Get the node at a given index
-   set
    -   Get a node at a given index then change its value
-   insert
    -   Insert a new node at a given index
-   remove
    -   Remove a node at a given index
-   reverse
    -   Reverse all the nodes where the head will be the tail and the head will be the tail

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Big O |
| --------- | ----- |
| Insertion | O(1)  |
| Removal   | O(N)  |
| Searching | O(N)  |
| Access    | O(N)  |

## Doubly Linked Lists

Compared to the singly linked lists, every node in a doubly linked lists contains two pointers corresponding to the next node and the previous node

It consumes more memory than a single linked lists. It has the same methods with a double linked list but the implementation are much faster.

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Big O |
| --------- | ----- |
| Insertion | O(1)  |
| Removal   | O(1)  |
| Searching | O(n)  |
| Access    | O(n)  |

## Stacks

Are abstract data structures that follows the principle of **Last In and First Out**

The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack

It can implemented using:

-   Arrays
    -   Disadvantage would be is you need to have a dynamic array to implement a stack
-   Linked Lists
    -   Disadvantage would be is that you do not have a random access for things on the stack

### Methods of Stack

| Method     | Description                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Push O(1)  | You push something at the top of the stack                       |
| Pop O(1)   | You remove something from the top of the stack                   |
| Peek O(1)  | You check the element at the top of the stack                    |
| Empty O(1) | Returns a boolean to determine whether the stack is empty or not |

## Queues

Abstract Data Structures that follows the **first in and first out** principle

### Methods of Queues

| Method       | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Enqueue O(1) | Add an item at the end of oue queue      |
| Dequeue O(1) | Remove an item at the start of the queue |

## Trees

A non-linear abstract data structure.

### Terminologies

-   Root
    -   The top node in a tree
-   Child
    -   A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
-   Parent
    -   The converse notion of a child
-   Siblings
    -   A group of nodes with the same parent
-   Leaf
    -   A node with no children
-   Edge
    -   The connection between one node and another

### Binary Search Tree

-   Every parent node has at most two children
-   Every node to the left of a parent node is **always less** than the parent
-   Every node to the right of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent
-   Use a self-balancing search tree to make all operations O(logn)

#### Time Complexity

| Method            | Description                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insertion O(logn) | Operation that allows us to insert things on our table               |
| Search O(logn)    | Operation that returns the node that we are searching for in our BST |

### Tree Traversal

A way where we visit all nodes of the tree

#### Breadth-first search

A way of traversing the tree level by level. Utilizes queue

#### Depth-first search

A way of traversing the node of the tree where we go down then go back up. To be able to use the inorder, preorder, and postorder kind of DFS, we need to use recursion

-   Inorder
    -   Arrangement of node is from the lowest to highest
-   PreOrder
    -   Arrangement of node is from first visit to last visit
-   PostOrder
    -   Arrangement of node is from last visited

##### InOrder vs PreOrder vs PostOrder

-   InOrder is good if we want to see a sorted value of our nodes in a tree
-   PreOrder is a good way to export our tree structure in a way that it can easily be replicated

#### Comparisons of the different ways to traverse a tree

-   Breadth-first search is the best if we are dealing with a tree that are narrower (number of children per level is very low) but deeper because its implementation allows lower space complexity
-   Depth-first search is the best if we are dealing with a tree that is wide (number of children per level is high) but less deep because its implementation allows lower space complexity.

## Heaps

is a **complete binary tree** that satisifes <u>_the heap invariant_</u> where any given node is:

-   Max Binary heap - parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
-   Min Binary heap - parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

### Priority Queue

A data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities

### Time Complexity of Heaps

| Method            | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insertion O(logn) | We push data from our heap and then we bubble up per priority                                  |
| Removal O(logn)   | We remove the item with the highest priority and then we get the last node then we bubble down |
| Search O(logn)    | Finding the element at the heap if it exists in our heap then we return it                     |

## Hash tables

## Graphs

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

### Graph Terminologies

-   **Vertex** - a node
-   **Edge** - the connection between vertices
-   **Weighted/Unweighted** - values assigned to distances between vertices
-   **Directed/Undirected** - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

# Dijkstra's Algorithms

An algorithm used for finding the shortest path from a vertex to another vertex on a graph
